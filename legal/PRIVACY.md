Non-personal information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or web site visitations). Sentrei may collect non-personal information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.

8\. Information Collected Through Technology
--------------------------------------------

While you are able to visit the Sentrei site and remain anonymous, Sentrei or its third party service providers may still collect non-personal information about your use of the Sentrei materials (e.g. Your internet browser, operating system, ip address, connection speed, and the domain name of your internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:

*   (a)**Cookies. Cookies,** including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your device’s hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Sentrei site. Cookies do not generally contain any personal information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Sentrei materials unavailable to you.
*   (b)**IP address.** You may visit many areas of the Sentrei site anonymously without the need to become a registered user. Even in such cases, Sentrei may collect ip addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin services with an internet services provider. Each time you access the Sentrei site and each time you request one of Sentrei’ pages, the server logs your ip address.
*   (c)**Beacons.** Beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. Sentrei may use these technical methods in html e-mails that Sentrei sends to users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that constitutes personal information.
*   (d)**Tracking content usage.** If you use the Sentrei services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, “content”) to your app site or to a third party app site, Sentrei tracks and captures non-personal information associated with user accounts and the use of content.

27\. Legal Bases for Processing (For EEA Users): 
-------------------------------------------------

If you are an individual in the European economic area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:
