### Describe something weird or unusual that you've built or done early on in life. (Visible during the Tournament)

I was obsessed with the typography of a typical Word document. Early on, I would spend hours trying to perfect the alignment, font size, and tweak settings so that my personal Word document of a Japanese translation of Harry Potter would meet my standards just to please myself.

### Who is someone you personally know that will have an incredible impact on the world one day?

Everyone. There are too many uncontrollable factors in life for one individual to be credited with all of the incredible impacts.

#### Describe how you know them & why you admire them.

Everyone. There are too many uncontrollable factors in life for one distinct individual to be credited with all of the positive impact towards the world.

### Describe a time when you intentionally broke the rules.

During a high school field trip to Kyoto, my friends and I decided to escape from the hotel at night to a nearby haunted temple as a means of testing our courage. Not satisfied and eager to go down in school history, we then decided to climb down the mountain to a national park.

## Your project

### What is your project? (Visible during the Tournament)

#### Please summarize your project in one sentence. Write as you would to a friend. The summary should be comprehensible to anyone in the world, with no domain expertise.

A focus oriented virtual workspace.

### What's new about this? (Visible during the Tournament)

Most current video conference apps are optimized for synchronous communication among individuals. However, most time at work is spent focusing which requires a distraction-free environment. Through an asynchronous and focus oriented UI, we help teams get things done.

### Why you? Why do you think you could do this? (Visible during the Tournament)

Over the last 20 years, there were absolutely zero startups born in Japan that have a present market cap of over \$10 billion.
Personally speaking, I am on a mission to prove that even Japanese entrepreneurs can create great software products used by people all around the world.

### Project details

#### What are you going to make? How will it work? Why will it be useful? Please be as descriptive as possible.

Virtual workspace tailored for teams to get things done.

Key Features.

1. Focus-oriented. You will not get distracted through notifications or your colleagues' keyboard noise. Reflect back on how productive you were through metrics and compete with your colleagues through a dedicated leaderboard.
2. Stress-free. Hop in to the same virtual room when you want to get work (same static link always!!!), and never worry about time-limits, invitations, or passcodes. No peripheral sound or avatar-like functions. Everything is minimalistic and kept simple.
3. Asynchronous video chat. Send video messages to each other while resting, or when you're tired and want to poke at others. Messages don't disappear since the virtual workspace is always available for you.
